     <h4> For this project we decided to make a mouse move through a maze filled with enemies in 
          order to reach a piece of cheese at the end. After reaching the cheese, the mouse would 
          continue into an enemy and "die". To create this project, we drew the background grid
          and imported the enemies as turtles. We created a mouse turtle and gave it custom
          movements to create its way around the maze. </h4>

     <h4> For this project, we decided to create an archery game with moving targets. Players enter
          their name and difficulty and then have 20 seconds to shoot as many targets as possible. While
          they try to get the targets, the targets are moving around the screen at a speed that is 
          based off the difficulty they chose.</h4>

     <h4> For this Scratch project, we decide to remix a parkour platformer game to add a challenge 
          aspect to our game. We changed the design, costumes, and levels for our game to make it
          original so we used a rabbit and scenery of nature. We got our rabbit to change costumes
          when it moves to give it the effect of running and there are 30 levels for the user to
          complete.</h4>
