     <h4> For this project we decided to make a mouse move through a maze filled with enemies in 
          order to reach a piece of cheese at the end. After reaching the cheese, the mouse would 
          continue into an enemy and "die". To create this project, we drew the background grid
          and imported the enemies as turtles. We created a mouse turtle and gave it custom
          movements to create its way around the maze. </h4>
